This internship provides me with a dynamic learning process affiliated with music cultures, digital technologies, and creative approaches to science and the world of data. For my role, I manage the videography aspect of the festival, visual content for social media promotion, and also work on the editorial side with my writing research on combining creative input with technological output.
