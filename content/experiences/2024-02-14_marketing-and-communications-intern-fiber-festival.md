Working with [FIBER Festival](https://fiberfestival.nl/)'s communication side in preparation for FIBER Festival 2024. My role consists of community marketing, photography and videography, and report writing. I had the pleasure of joining FIBER's team for the 2024 edition in Amsterdam with a varied and impressive artist lineup, with performances, concerts, exhibitions, and a context programme.
