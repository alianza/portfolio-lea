  Initially starting with an internship and working full-time afterwards, Dutch
  Review brought me closer to the sphere of digital marketing, online
  journalism, and, most of course, Dutch culture.


  I wrote daily news, cultural pieces, and weekly newsletters. I learned how to write clearly and adhere to certain writing style guides. Additionally, I became more familiar with SEO writing techniques, sponsored articles, and affiliate links.

M﻿y role as editor at Dutch Review was based in managerial work, proofreading, and providing constructive writing feedback. I also curated our social media channels and managed our content calendar. My additional role as Business Development manager enabled me to network with other companies through community management at Dutch Review.
