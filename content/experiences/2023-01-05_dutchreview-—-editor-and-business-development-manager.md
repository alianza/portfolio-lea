I﻿'m grateful that [DutchReview](https://dutchreview.com/) kept me on their team after the end of internship, allowing me to pursue more important roles at the company. 

M﻿y role as an editor at DutchReview is a multifaceted one. I was in charge of selecting stories for the day, editing the articles, and managing the daily content calendar. Through close reading, I learned how to catch errors and manners of writing that don't necessarily fit into our style guide.

My position as a Business Development manager also helped me gain insights in how to communicate and keep relations with other companies and people.
