During my studies, I was able to improve my critical thinking and research skills much more than I could've imagined. Choosing my path in Media and Information studies really kickstarted my career in journalism; it was only at the end of my third academic year that I realized I wanted to write for a living. 

With this major, I delved into topics of data and platform capitalism, the digitized world, questions about privacy and user agency. Additionally, I got the opportunity to choose extracurricular classes that focused on issues of identity, nationality, and other cultural phenomena. 

I ended my final semester with a Minor in Sociology, which really opened my eyes to concepts of intersectionality, migration, urbanization, postcolonial thought, and general sociological theories along with their arguable philosophers — namely Frantz Fanon, Stuart Hall, and Kimberlé Crenshaw.
