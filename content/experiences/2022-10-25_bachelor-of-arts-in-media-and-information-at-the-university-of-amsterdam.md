My three-year study in Media and Information at the faculty of Humanities. I also completed a minor in Sociology (Social Sciences department) in my final year. My graduating thesis focused on web shops as consumer-exploiting platforms by using interface and tracking strategies. Read my thesis [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fHAL7Kafbgrad81v-iCxRFSCZBxVMPSSHErHbS25HSY/edit?usp=sharing)

With this major, I delved into topics of data and platform capitalism, the digitised world, questions about privacy and user agency. Additionally, I got the opportunity to choose extracurricular classes that focused on issues of identity, nationality, and other cultural phenomena. 

I ended my final semester with a Minor in Sociology, where i studied themes of intersectionality, migration, urbanisation, postcolonial thought, and basic sociological theories.
