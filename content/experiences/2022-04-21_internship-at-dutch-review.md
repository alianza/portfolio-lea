  learnt so much about different writing styles, content management and working
  in a professional environment.

Interning at DutchReview taught me so many things about digital media and the inner workings of journalism. 

I became very familiar with writing daily news, selecting accurate news sources, and working with social media platform tools. I also got the opportunity to visit and review several attractions, which I otherwise wouldâ€™ve never seen! 

To top off my experience at DutchReview, my colleagues provided me with many laughs, support, and, of course, large amounts of coffee!
