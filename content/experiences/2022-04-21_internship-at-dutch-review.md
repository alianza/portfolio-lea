description: "My first step into the world of digital journalism: my internship
  at Dutch Review in the lovely city of Leiden. I became acquainted with the
  digital media landscape, developed an eye for resourceful news, and was able
  to collaborate with other companies while doing so. "

My internship at DutchReview brought me closer to the sphere of digital marketing, online journalism, and, most of course, Dutch culture.\
\
I wrote daily news, cultural pieces, and weekly newsletters. I learned how to write clearly and adhere to a certain writing style guide. Additionally, I became more familiar with SEO writing techniques, sponsored articles, and affiliate links.\
\
I learned how to collect and analyse certain data based on social media engagements, which allowed me to gain a clear overview on what needs to be ameliorated. I was also representing Dutch Review at several business events in Tilburg, Leiden, and Amsterdam. \
\
I am thankful that I was able to continue working at DutchReview as an editor and business development manager, which improved both my writing and salesmanship skills.
