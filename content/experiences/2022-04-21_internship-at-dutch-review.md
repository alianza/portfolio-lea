  learnt so much about the digital media landscape, developed an eye for
  resourceful news, and enjoyed collaborating with other companies. "

Interning at DutchReview taught me so many things about digital media and the inner workings of journalism. 

I became very familiar with writing daily news, selecting accurate news sources, and working with social media platform tools. I also got the opportunity to visit and review several attractions, which I otherwise would’ve never seen! 

To top off my experience at DutchReview, my colleagues provided me with many laughs, support, and, of course, large amounts of coffee!

I am thankful that I was able to continue working at DutchReview as an editor and business development manager, which pushes me in the complex world of journalism and media marketing.
