description: "My first step into the world of digital journalism: my internship
  at Dutch Review in the lovely city of Leiden. I became acquainted with the
  digital media landscape, developed an eye for resourceful news, and was able
  to collaborate with other companies while doing so. "
---
Interning at DutchReview taught me so many things about digital media and the inner workings of journalism.\
\
I became very familiar with writing daily news, cultural pieces, and weekly newsletters. I learned how to write clearly and adhere to a certain writing style guide. Additionally, I became more familiar with SEO writing techniques, sponsored articles, and affiliate links.\
\
I also learned how to collect and analyse certain data based on social media engagements which allowed me to gain a clear overview on what needs to be ameliorated. All in all, I was gladly part of several social events and attractions in Tilburg, Leiden, and Amsterdam, which I otherwise would’ve never known about!\
\
To top off my experience at DutchReview, my colleagues provided me with many laughs, support, and, of course, large amounts of coffee!\
\
I am thankful that I was able to continue working at DutchReview as an editor and business development manager, which pushes me in the complex world of journalism and media marketing.
