I was very glad to be part of [Salwa Foundation](https://salwa.nl/)'s first residency exhibition and to have met their diverse team. My role consisted of opening and closing exhibition space, fixing last-minute touch-ups, greeting and informing guests about artists and artworks, setting up artworks and managing event space.

### SALWA FOUNDATION Internet Café

SALWA offers residencies and programs for migrant artists, as a way to link upcoming artists to the booming art scene in the Netherlands. The Internet Café exhibition displayed artwork from four artists (Hala Al Sadi, Geo Barcan, Chen-Yu Wang, Sixin Zeng) at W139 throughout July 2023.
