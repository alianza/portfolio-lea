  My submission for Creature Magazine's first issue: "RAW: experiencing
  Amsterdam's street skateboarding subculture". Published April 29, 2022. 


  Iï»¿ loved working with Creatur on this because they were open to pretty much any type of submission. It allowed to me inspire my own research and combine my passions of skateboarding and writing.
