  Photography + Formatting + Printing + Cutting = Grafficity. 


  This zine is a message of appreciation to Amsterdam's graffiti scene and zooms into the connections between the artform and the physical surfaces of the city. I had the honor to showcase/sell this zine at the SPREAD zine fest in Het Resort, Groningen, in October 2024.
