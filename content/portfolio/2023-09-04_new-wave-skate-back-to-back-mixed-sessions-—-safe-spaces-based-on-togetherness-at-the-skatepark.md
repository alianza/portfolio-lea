description: "I wrote a piece about NWS (New Wave Skate's Mixed Sessions event.
  NWS is a series of skateboarding sessions for women and queer skaters in the
  Netherlands. While they usually organise events for women and queer
  communities, they decided to have an open mixed session in an effort to bridge
  the subculture with the more dominant scene, and let these two communities
  co-exist at the skatepark. In this piece, I talk about NWS and the
  skateboarding subculture and I interview Anne, one of the organisers of the
  event, for Essay Skateboard Magazine. "
