  Info:

  Casimir presents Deviations (Live) - Concert I: Organ/Body


  For the opening concert of FIBER Festival, Casimir Geelhoed will present a premiere of ‘Deviations’, a performance for hyperorgan and live processing that breathes new life into an old instrument. Focussing on timbre, texture, and harmonic structure, the composition invites an exploration of the friction, instability, and fragility that emerges when acoustically produced sound and layers reproduced through a spatial sound system clash and merge in the physical space. Be ready to sharpen your listening and submit to this bodily experience.


  Casimir Geelhoed will perform during our festival opening concert night called ‘Organ/Body’, taking place at The Orgelpark.
