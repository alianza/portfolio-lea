description: "As Friday evening grew dark, I was blessed to attend Maya al
  Khaldi and Sarouna’s performance at Het Koorenhuis, Den Haag, for Rewire 2024.
  With Sarouna on the sound mixer, qanun – traditional Arabic string instrument
  – and Maya Al Khaldi’s voice, their harmonious yet grief-laden sounds pierced
  through the audience during the show. The Palestinian artists’ focus on themes
  of nostalgia, longing, and reminiscence – common topics among today’s Arab
  diaspora – were brought into the concert space through longings of the past
  and Levantine Arabic lyrics from their debut album (2022) Other World عالم
  تاني, which hit really close to home. Mixing in each of these songs are
  lyrics, melodies, or samples of audio recordings from the Popular Art Center
  in Ramallah. Full of percussion and folklore, Maya al Khaldi and Sarouna
  create a soundscape of rattling pasts in the midst of collapsing
  contemporaries. "
