As I sit and criticise the outlines of my contours, my lungs deflate each time I breathe out a sigh of discomfort. 

Picking my body apart as the endings of my nerves calculate the times I go over the stretchmarks on my lower hips. 

My spinal cord, which acts as the mailing system of my anatomy, takes it upon itself to pass countless messages from my brain to my body. 

I hope it classifies all the negative things I've said about my inner thighs, my crooked septum, my upper arms, and the left side of my face as spam; I hope my brain doesn't believe me in my times of vulnerability. 

After filling my stomach well, the roundness of my belly circles my entire focus. 

I seem to ignore how the yellow bile in my gallbladder works in my favour. It breaks down the fats in my stomach to ease my digestion. 

Have I forgotten how my small intestine takes up all the nutrients from what I just ate and injects them so powerfully into my bloodstream? 

Why does something as minute as a well-fed belly overshadow the magic that is the automatism of my bodywork?

By midday, my cells would've already regenerated about a hundred billion times. The passive perfection of mitosis that occurs in me works beyond my understanding. 

I wish I could conceive a mirror which captures the excellence of my inner body. Instead, when the thought of what I look like pops up, I focus on my outer physical self, and linger on its inaccuracies and asymmetrical proportions.   

Why is it that I don't know where all my organs are but my cerveau knows it like the back of my hand? Is this not the same hand that I used to point out all my flaws yesterday? 

The metropolis of synapses and the billions of neurons that drive my brain are so alive and loud.

Sooner or later, they quickly become muffled by the rapid fire of my self-sabotaging thoughts.

Why do I have three rolls on my stomach when I sit so comfortably? Why does the curvature of my back bother me so much? Why can I not appreciate my body for what it is? For all the things it does for me? 

The realness of my physicality conceals the wonders of myself. All I experience are its effects on my outer body. 

A pimple rises to my cheek in the morning. I notice cellulite on my skin after lunch. The afternoon sun highlights the hairs I tweezed off my eyebrows last week. How do they grow back so fast?

As nighttime approaches and I drift into another slumber, my brain will lie wide awake. It extracts all the toxins and memory waste I gathered that day while my body plays housekeeper and freshens me up to utter perfection.

Alas, I will not notice the novelty of my renewed mind when I wake up tomorrow. Instead, I'll look at myself in the mirror and wonder why I haven't changed at all since yesterday.
