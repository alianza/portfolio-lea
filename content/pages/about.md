title: About

Its rather hard to come up with an introduction for yourself. You can present "I" in many different ways and you have so little space to fill in. I guess I'd call myself a writer, a skater and a reader. I also love to talk about new stories and come up with theories about the world and all its scattered societies. I also love taking pictures, not that I would call myself a photographer or anything. Rather, it's an enjoyable hobby. 

For a formal introduction, my name is Lea and I come from Lebanon, Abu Dhabi and the US. I mostly identify with my Lebanese heritage, even though I've never actually resided there. I study Media and Information at the Unversity of Amsterdam and will soon be graduated. I'd like to point my life in a direction where I can freely write about or criticise elements in society and culture. As I've always wanted a life which offers new things to me every day, writing has always been able to scratch that spot. Happy reading.
