It's rather hard to come up with an introduction for myself. I'll call myself a writer, a skater and a photographer. 

For a more formal introduction, my name is Lea and I am from Lebanon, but was raised in Abu Dhabi (UAE) and born in the United States. I identify mostly with my Lebanese heritage, since my entire family originates from there. In 2019, I moved from the UAE to the Netherlands, Amsterdam for my studies at the University of Amsterdam. 

I majored in Media and Information and minored in Sociology, and graduated with cum laude. My Bachelor years showed me that I have a passion for concept writing and concept storytelling. Professionally, I write columns and news reports, but also do video and photography content. I also enjoy producing music, skateboarding, and combining visual and written work.
