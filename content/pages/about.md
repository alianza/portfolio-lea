title: About

It's rather hard to come up with an introduction for myself. I'll call myself a writer, a skater and a photographer. Collaborating with other creative minds is one of my literary passions, as I find inspiration in everything and everyone but myself. 

For a more formal introduction, my name is Lea and I come from Lebanon, Abu Dhabi and the US. I mostly identify with my Lebanese heritage, since my entire family comes from there. Though, funny as it is, Ive never even actually lived in my home country. In 2019, I moved from the United Arab Emirates to Amsterdam for my studies at the University of Amsterdam. 

I majored in Media and Information and graduated with Cum Laude, which I'm very grateful for. My Bachelor years taught me that I loved to write as it gave me the creative freedom to come up with my own research topics. I took every assignment as a journalistic opportunity, based in research, creation and literature. It made clear that I wanted to point my life in a direction where I can freely write about and criticise elements in society and culture. And, since I've always wanted a career which offers new things to me every day, writing has always been able to scratch that spot. Happy reading, everyone!
