title: About

Its rather hard to come up with an introduction for yourself. I guess I'd call myself a writer, a skater and an observer. I love collaborating with other creative minds and producing different types of content; essays, most preferably.

For a formal introduction, my name is Lea and I come from Lebanon, Abu Dhabi and the US. I mostly identify with my Lebanese heritage, even though I've never actually lived there. I completed my Media and Information study at the Unversity of Amsterdam. I'd like to point my life in a direction where I can freely write about or criticise elements in society and culture. As I've always wanted a life which offers new things to me every day, writing has always been able to scratch that spot. Happy reading.
