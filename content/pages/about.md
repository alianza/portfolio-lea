Writer. Reader. Skater. Student. Master of None. 

I fell in love with language through books and decided to use my writing and research skills for personal experience. After this decision, the world began showing itself to me in written poetry and love letters. 

This website aims to showcase my (love for) writing, both personal and professional.
