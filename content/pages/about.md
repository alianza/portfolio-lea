It's rather hard to come up with an introduction for myself. I'll call myself a writer, a skater and a photographer. 

For a more formal introduction, my name is Lea and I am from Lebanon, but was raised in Abu Dhabi (UAE) and born in the United States. I identify mostly with my Lebanese heritage, since my entire family originates from there. Though, as funny as it seems, Ive never even actually lived there but spent my whole life in the UAE. In 2019, I moved from the UAE to the Netherlands, Amsterdam for my studies at the University of Amsterdam. 

I majored in Media and Information and minored in Sociology, and graduated with cum laude, which I'm very grateful for. My Bachelor years taught me that I loved to write, as my studies allowed me the creative freedom of making my own research topics. I took every assignment as a journalistic opportunity, based in research, creation and literature. I understood that I wanted to continue my journalistic feats and point my life in a direction where I can freely write about and criticise elements in society and culture. Since I've always wanted a career which offers new things to me every day, writing has always been able to scratch that spot.
