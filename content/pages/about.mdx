Writer. Reader. Skater. Student. Master of None. 

I fell in love with language through books and decided to use my love for writing and research to create new connections and ideas. After this decision, the world began showing itself to me via written poetry and love letters. 

This website aims to showcase my (love for) writing, both personal and professional.
